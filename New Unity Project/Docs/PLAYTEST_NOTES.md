# Chris's playtest notes

Chris jots these down as he plays. Each note keeps his words, what was measured, and what happened to it.
Status: OPEN (not started), PLANNED (design decided), FIXED (published; says which publish).

## 1. The bandit camp is way too close to the village (2026-10-01) — OPEN
> "one thing i notice is the bandit camp is way too close to the village. i asked before to expand the zone."

Measured in `oakhaven.json` (the village green is at about (-8, -8)):
- The first Sandthrone deserters stand at (-16, 84.5): 93 m north of the green and only about 25 m past the Woodyard
  (-24, 60). Crowsfoot Hollow's mouth is at (-16, 93), 100 m out. That is a 15-20 second walk from the Great Oak.
- The Old Orchard (-55, 88) and the Carder farm (-61, 45) are as close to the bandits as to the village.
- The cave runs north from there to Caddock at (-0.8, 175.6), against the zone's north edge (the zone is 380 m, so the edge
  is at 190). There is no room to push the hollow further out without growing the zone.
- The 2026-09-30 growth (260 to 380 m) added places in the new ground but left the hollow's mouth where it was.

What the fix needs: grow Oakhaven again and move the whole of Crowsfoot Hollow (mouth, cave, the camps in it, Caddock and
Hesk, the quest's objective points, its secrets and the rich copper seams) well out, so there is real country between the
village and the bandits: farms and fields first, then wolves and boar, then the hills and the hidden mouth. Target: the
mouth about 280 m from the green (three times today's distance). Also check the other camps against the same rule (nothing
hostile within about 120 m of a village's houses) in every zone.

## 2. Elites are too easy for the loot they give (2026-10-01) — OPEN
> "elite was too easy for the loot obtain."

Measured (`EncounterEnemy.MobHealth` / `MobHit`): a camp elite is a normal mob of its level with 2.2 times the health and 1.4
times the hit, drawn 1.18 times the size. It has no ability of its own, its camp does not come to its aid (see note 3), and
with Mira healing nothing threatens the player. From loot step L1 an elite is the only source of a blue beam, and from L2 each
drops its own named rare or epic, so the reward has outgrown the fight.
The twelve camp elites: Caddock, Quartermaster Hesk, Old Whitefoot (Oakhaven); the Grey Sexton, the Pale Reckoner (Khaven);
the Sandthrone captain, Old Scree-Tusk (Peaks); the Brood Weave-Eater, the Ash-Deacon (Ash Rim); Greyheart, Old Ninebranch,
the Hollow Root-Warden (Verdant Shore).

What the fix needs: elites that are a fight. More health and a harder hit; one or two moves of their own that the player must
answer (a wound-up heavy blow to step out of or guard, an enrage when low, a call that brings the camp); their guards joined
to them; and bosses at a dungeon's end harder than the outdoor named beasts. Tune so an elite of the player's level is
dangerous alone and wants Mira, and one two levels up is not a solo kill.

## 3. Mobs are not social: they pull one at a time (2026-10-01) — OPEN
> "some mobs need to be more social. i can pull them easy 1 at a time even when they stand next to each other"

Measured (`EncounterEnemy.Update`): every mob notices the player by itself, within 5 m and with a clear line; nothing links
it to its neighbours. Hitting or walking up to one of four wolves, or one of Caddock's guards, brings that one alone.

What the fix needs: social aggro by kind. When a mob joins a fight, others of its camp within reach join too: pack beasts
(wolves, hounds) come together; people (deserters, cultists, Concord) call out and bring those in earshot, with a short
delay and a shout so it reads; solitary beasts (boar, stags) stay single. Sneaking (Ctrl) should still let a careful player
peel the edge of a camp. A boss always fights with its guards.
